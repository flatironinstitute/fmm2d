Fast multipole methods in two dimensions (fmm2d)

`fmm2d <https://github.com/flatironinstitute/fmm2d>`_ 
is a set of libraries to compute N-body interactions 
governed by the Laplace and Helmholtz equations,
to a specified precision, in three dimensions,
on a multi-core shared-memory machine.
The library is written in Fortran,
wrappers will soon be available for C, MATLAB, and Python.
As an example, given $M$ arbitrary points $y_j \in \mathbb{R}^{2}$ 
with corresponding real numbers $c_j$, and 
$N$ arbitrary points $x_{j} \in \mathbb{R}^{2}$, the Laplace FMM
evaluates the $N$ real numbers

.. math:: u_{\ell} = \sum_{j=1}^M c_j\log{\| x_{\ell} - y_{j}\|} ~, 
   \qquad \mbox{ for } \; \ell=1,2,\ldots N ~.
   :label: lapcp

The $y_j$ can be interpreted as source locations, $c_j$
as charge strengths, and $u_{\ell}$ as the resulting potential at
target location $x_{\ell}$.

Such N-body interactions are needed in many applications in 
science and engineering, including molecular dynamics, astrophysics, 
rheology, and the numerical solution of partial differential equations.
The naive CPU effort to evaluate :eq:`lapcp` is $O(NM)$.
The FMM approximates :eq:`lapcp` to a requested relative precision
$\epsilon$ with linear effort $O((M+N) \log (1/\epsilon))$.

The FMM relies on compressing the interactions between well-separated 
clusters of source and target points at a hierarchy of scales using
analytic outgoing, incoming, and plane-wave 
expansions of the interaction kernel and associated translation
operators. 
This library is an improved version of the `FMMLIB2D <https://github.com/zgimbutas/fmmlib2d>`_
software, Copyright (C) 2010-2012: Leslie Greengard and Zydrunas Gimbutas, released under the 
BSD license. 
The major improvements are the following:

-  Vectorization of the FMM, to apply the same kernel with the same source and target locations to multiple 
   strength vectors
-  A redesign of the adaptive tree data structure
-  Diagonal form translation operators for high frequency Helmholtz
   problems

   
.. note::

   For very small repeated problems (less than 1000 input and output points),
   users should also consider dense matrix-matrix multiplication using
   BLAS3 (eg DGEMM,ZGEMM).
